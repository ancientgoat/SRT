Based on the project :  https://github.com/nurkiewicz/spring-data-jdbc-repository.git

This example is a Prototype of a prototype of a pre-alpha version, written
in as an alpha-skunkworks project.

## Summary

The concepts I indeed to show are as follows:
 * Gradle, one project making separate jars for each sub-project.
   * The same as Maven only better.  Uses maven stuff, like the '.m2'
        directory, and Maven repositories.
 * Spring Boot
   * Spring Boot can be integrated into an Apache/Tomcat installiation
        via AJP.  https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/ajp.html
        This is not explained further in this example.
 * Intro to Spring Data - one of my faviorate things EVER!
 * Spring Rest/MVC
 * Introducing Spring Data-Lite with JDBCTemplate (stolen and modified)
 * A bit of FHIR in action.

## Sayings
 * "Read the error, fix the error."
 * If you do it twice, do it once.
 * And everyone's favorite, Measure twice, cut once.
